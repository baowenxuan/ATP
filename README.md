## Introduction

- We consider a novel setting named *Test-Time Personalized Federated Learning*, addressing the challenge of
  personalizing a global model to each *unparticipating client* during test-time, without requiring any labeled data.
- We propose *ATP*, which adaptively learns the adaptation rate for each module, enabling it to handle different types
  of distribution shifts among FL clients.

Details of the codebase are coming soon.
